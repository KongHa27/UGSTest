# Package import notes

Built-in: Install Shader Graph package
HDRP: Change LOD Bias in project settings to 2 (default is 1)

Import Text Mesh Pro essentials if prompted
Change light intensity if needed

PS: I highly recommend getting NaughtyAttributes, it makes nested lists in the inspector much more readable and easier to edit
